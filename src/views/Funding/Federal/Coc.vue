                            The Continuum of Care (CoC) Program is designed to
                            promote communitywide commitment to the goal of
                            ending homelessness; provide funding for efforts by
                            nonprofit providers, and State and local governments
                            to quickly rehouse homeless individuals and families
                            while minimizing the trauma and dislocation caused
                            to homeless individuals, families, and communities
                            by homelessness; promote access to and effect

                            Under the CoC Program interim rule, eligible
                            applicants consist of nonprofit organizations, State
                            and local governments, instrumentalities of local
                            governments, and public housing agencies. An
                            eligible applicant must be designated by the
                            Continuum of Care to submit an application to HUD
                            for grant funds. The Continuum's designation must
                            state whether the Continuum is designating more than
                            one applicant to apply for funds, and if it is,
                            which applicant is being designated as the
                            Collaborative Applicant. A Continuum of Care that is
                            designating only one applicant for funds must
                            designate that applicant to be the Collaborative
                            Applicant. For-profit entities are not eligible to
                            apply for grants or to be subrecipients of grant
                            funds.

                            The CoC Program interim rule provides that Continuum
                            of Care Program funds may be used for projects under
                            five program components: permanent housing,
                            transitional housing, supportive services only,
                            HMIS, and, in some cases, homelessness prevention.
                            Administrative costs are eligible under all
                            components. Where possible, the components set forth
                            in the Continuum of Care Program are consistent with
                            the components allowable under the Emergency
                            Solutions Grants program. This eases the
                            administrative burden on recipients of both programs
                            and ensures that reporting requirements and data
                            quality benchmarks are consistently established and
                            applied to like projects. One significant
                            distinction between the Emergency Solutions Grants
                            Program and the CoC Program can be found in the
                            eligible activities and administration requirements
                            for assistance provided under the rapid re-housing
                            component in this interim rule.

Further, leases (or subleases) must be renewable for a minimum term of one month.

Permanent supportive housing is permanent housing with indefinite leasing or rental assistance paired with supportive services to assist homeless persons with a disability or families with an adult or child member with a disability achieve housing stability.
